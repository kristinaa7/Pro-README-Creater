# Professional README File Generator

## Description
The README file generator is a helpful user friendly application that takes user input and creates a "README.md" file by simply answering 9 prompt questions. The file that is generated includes the appropriate header and subheadings sizing along with a table of contents. The questions subheader will contain your email and github link for users to connect with you.

## Installation
In order for the generator to work accurately, node version 16 is required and the inquirer package 8.2.4. Since the file already includes the inquirer package, please run "npm install" in the terminal.

## Usage
1. Ensure that node version 16 is downloaded on your computer, type the following code in the terminal
```
node --v 
```
2. Install the inquirer package
```
npm install
```
3. Run the prompts in the terminal
```
node index.js
```
